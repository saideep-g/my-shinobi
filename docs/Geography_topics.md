How to make this work for two ages:
For the 8-year-old: Focus on Superlatives. The Tallest mountain, the Longest river, the Hottest desert. Use a physical "Passport" where she gets a sticker for every landmark "visited."

For the 13-year-old: Focus on Connections. Why is the Atacama desert next to the Andes? How did the Nile allow the Pharaohs to build pyramids?
